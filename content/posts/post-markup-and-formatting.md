## Chapter 2

While researching various sources, many scholars have argued similar, opposing, and contradictory ideas surrounding arranged marriage. These perspectives varied due to scholars coming from different backgrounds, countries, and fields of study. While some sources related more to the topic than others, they all were important in unraveling the main factors involved in arranged marriage, or traditional marriage in some cases. The multiple perspectives opened up more conversations than expected, stating the setbacks and positive outcomes of arranged marriage, as well as the actors involved in this practice. Scholars with differing backgrounds addressed the agency, consanguinity, age, financial, cultural aspects of arranged marriage, along with the power dynamics that can form as a result. Based on various articles and chapters, arranged marriage is not one thing, although a few scholars think so. While scholars held opposing opinions, all of them had agreed on the significance of one common factor. The commonality between the sources was the important role of education within this practice. Most scholars would agree that the role education plays in arranged marriages is extremely critical when analyzing the practice from multiple lenses, as well as the factors of age, financial status, agency, consanguinity, and the overall pressures of marriage.
