## History of Marriage in Morocco

Rites of passage that people consider valuable, traditional, and respectable differs between communities. Every country has an unspoken road map for when education, marriage, and family planning should begin. While some countries place a higher value on some social benchmarks than others, marriage is a tradition that is for the most part, universal. While marriage is overall a universal practice, the process of finding a spouse is specific to each culture. In Moroccan culture, finding a spouse is not only expected, but widely encouraged. Throughout the few months I spent in Morocco, I witnessed first hand the cultural significance of marriage, seeing how varying communities in Morocco practiced and valued it. The most apparent difference I saw was how Moroccan college students viewed marriage, compared to how women of the same age range in rural areas viewed marriage. This was a difference I felt was worthy of exploration. This composition will answer the question of how education impacts marital trends and practices in Morocco through literature review, qualitative, and quantitative analysis.
