> Throughout this project, many scholarly sources and data were examined to answer the question of how higher education impacts marital practices in Morocco. This project was able to provide a small portion of the answer, that increased higher education increases the age at which Moroccans get married. This was figured out through analyzing scholarly articles from authors of various fields of study, and analysis of data collected from the World Bank, World Health Organization, and United Nations. While this was an enlightening conclusion to reach, it is clear that there is much more research to be done on this topic, as both qualitative and quantitative research are essential for a holistic understanding of a society. It is critical to utilize both approaches to research, especially if one component is lacking, as one approach can not tell a full story.
