### Results
After reading literature that identified the effects higher education has on marital practices in Morocco, as well as conducting my own statistical analysis, many questions were answered. Scholars have recognized the many ways education affects marriage, acknowledging health, age, and priority shifts that arise. Once these impacts were identified, I pulled some of these factors into my own research. Using Python to visualize the relationships between college enrollment, marriage, the circumstances through which spouses meet, health, age, and labor participation, I was able to analyze these variables by calculating correlations, mean, standard deviation, and covariance, and created graphs to see if the quantitative data supported the qualitative research. I have concluded that an increase in higher education has increased the age at which spouses get married in Morocco in the past ten years. The results of these conclusions are expressed both in this chapter and the website. All statistical results reached in this chapter were produced by programming in Python, utilizing their statistical and graphing libraries.
